# Matterways Challenge

This project uses socket.io for communication between the client and the server.\
In real world scenario, the communication happens between multiple browser tabs or across multiple browsers.\

# How does it work?

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
Open more than one tabs or two different browsers.
The UI has a `Test Events` button. When the button is clicked on any of the tab, you can see the events logged on all the open tabs. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

Install all the dependency modules.

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
